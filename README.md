# pstpython
.pst parsing to generate report and mail / save locally

This is not anything special or optimized in any way, I just wanted to automate a task of going through e-mails generated by vFiler for error reporting and using local Outlook account to send it out. 
There are similar programs and repositories out there but they were to complex in my mind so just wanted something short and fairly snappy that was not meant for anybody else to use.
Just to run by myself. I'll upload it for those who might find it to enjoy.
